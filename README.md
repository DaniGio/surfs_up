# surfs_up

## Project overview

Creating a business case to open a Surf nâ€™ Shake shop, serving surf boards and ice cream

## Resources

Software: SQlite, SQAlchemy, Flask

Database: hawaii.sqlite with weather data

## Summary
After analyzing the data, it is possible to observe that some months have higher amounts of precipitation and higher temperature than others. 

Below some statistical information to compare June and December:
- more observations in June than in December
- Min Temp in June was 64F and in December 56F
- Max temp in June was 85F and in December 83F
- The avarage temperature in June is 74F and in December 71F
- The precipitation of rain in December is higher than in June with the average of 0.2 and max of 6.4 inches

It is possible to see that we had more data to analyze in June than in December, that although it rained more times in June, the precipitation was less than 2 inches, and in December we had higher than 2 inches

Looking at this plot, we can infer that a vast majority of the observations were over 70 degrees for both months. 
In June we not only captured more days with 75F but we also captured warmers days getting to 85F

## Recommendation

To finalize the business case, it is recommended to conduct some further analysis, not only quantitatively but also qualitatively investigations:
1)	Understand if precipitation and temperature differ between locations
2)	Identify the competitors in each of those locations if any
3)	Analyze rent/buy prices per location
4)	Analyze best surf areas (qualitative survey)
